3.0,"While I've reviewed this before, I decided to edit my response to my current opinion. The game is great, the graphics are stunning, and the stories are nice. However, it's very long and excessive. It makes it feel more like a chore. As you get more into the end game, getting rewards is a struggle, and farming and upgrading characters is more of a hassle than it should be. The resin (energy) cap should be upgraded, or costs of energy should be lowered. This game is very good, just time consuming.",88.0,positive,while ive reviewed this before i decided to edit my response to my current opinion the game is great the graphics are stunning and the stories are nice however its very long and excessive it makes it feel more like a chore as you get more into the end game getting rewards is a struggle and farming and upgrading characters is more of a hassle than it should be the resin energy cap should be upgraded or costs of energy should be lowered this game is very good just time consuming,
3.0,Very fun but I wish there was more fighting in the quests. It's just a bunch of talking and running around when it comes to the quests that just make me want to leave the game. It brings me in with the potential for awesome battles but then turns me off with all the dialogue that you can't skip. Has a lot of potential. At leave give us the ability to SKIP the dialogue.,35.0,positive,very fun but i wish there was more fighting in the quests its just a bunch of talking and running around when it comes to the quests that just make me want to leave the game it brings me in with the potential for awesome battles but then turns me off with all the dialogue that you cant skip has a lot of potential at leave give us the ability to skip the dialogue,
3.0,"Fun game, I enjoy the story. There is tons to do and tons of content to clear, so if you're bored, pick it up! The problem with it, however, is the long time between character reruns. It has been over a year since some characters are available and it is really killing enjoyment for a lot of people when they aren't able to get their favorites.",11.0,positive,fun game i enjoy the story there is tons to do and tons of content to clear so if youre bored pick it up the problem with it however is the long time between character reruns it has been over a year since some characters are available and it is really killing enjoyment for a lot of people when they arent able to get their favorites,
5.0,"This game is phenomenal. The art style and scenery are stunning. Yes, the game is long, but that's why it's fun. It takes you on several journeys and gives you memories worth remembering. The combat is fun as well, and the devs are working on storage control for those having issues with game size. I would ignore all those hateful/spam reviews as it's mostly just bots or people trying to ruin the joy for others.",77.0,positive,this game is phenomenal the art style and scenery are stunning yes the game is long but thats why its fun it takes you on several journeys and gives you memories worth remembering the combat is fun as well and the devs are working on storage control for those having issues with game size i would ignore all those hatefulspam reviews as its mostly just bots or people trying to ruin the joy for others,
2.0,"I love this game. However, it is incredibly laggy to the point where it's unplayable. I have all the graphics on the lowest setting, including the FPS, and yet it still somehow manages to crash. It isn't my storage because I have lots of it to the point where Genshin barely makes a dent in it, and it isn't my wifi because it runs smoothly for all the other apps. Please fix this and optimize it better for mobile players.",14.0,negative,i love this game however it is incredibly laggy to the point where its unplayable i have all the graphics on the lowest setting including the fps and yet it still somehow manages to crash it isnt my storage because i have lots of it to the point where genshin barely makes a dent in it and it isnt my wifi because it runs smoothly for all the other apps please fix this and optimize it better for mobile players,
3.0,I used to be obsessed with this game but I haven't played it in months because of how boring and repetitive the gameplay has gotten. The developers also don't care very much about player feedback and seem to pick and choose what feedback they use to incorporate into quality of life changes. Speaking of which it took them 4 years to implement some QoL changes that have been requested for years. A shame but Genshin Impact's dev team needs to do better.,99.0,positive,i used to be obsessed with this game but i havent played it in months because of how boring and repetitive the gameplay has gotten the developers also dont care very much about player feedback and seem to pick and choose what feedback they use to incorporate into quality of life changes speaking of which it took them years to implement some qol changes that have been requested for years a shame but genshin impacts dev team needs to do better,
5.0,"Highly recommend. I have been playing the game since last year (2023) and have been very impressed with the mechanics and captivated by the storyline. Constant updates keep the game interesting and ensure that the player stays engaged. Lore is impressive. Graphics are great during gameplay, and ABSOLUTELY AWESOME during cutscenes, especially since 5.0 update. Very very impressed. Have reccomended to many of my friends and all have enjoyed and are still playing the game till this day.",65.0,positive,highly recommend i have been playing the game since last year and have been very impressed with the mechanics and captivated by the storyline constant updates keep the game interesting and ensure that the player stays engaged lore is impressive graphics are great during gameplay and absolutely awesome during cutscenes especially since update very very impressed have reccomended to many of my friends and all have enjoyed and are still playing the game till this day,

But, lately, whenever I try to open it, it says that the game has a bug and kicks me out before I even get to the loading screen.

The style is nice, not TOO much fan service, The characters are all interesting in their own ways, and there's soooooo much more that's gonna be added to the game not making it boring!!

1.0,"Uninteresting characters, uninteresting dialog, a story with potential that isn't told very well. It has been 5 years and the games story isn't complete, I would have rather they not relesed it until there was more.It gets boring very quickly, usually in other open world adventures games, I find myself exploring the gorgeous open world for hours, engrossed in the story and, enjoying well written characters, yet this game can deliver in none of those things.",14.0,negative,uninteresting characters uninteresting dialog a story with potential that isnt told very well it has been years and the games story isnt complete i would have rather they not relesed it until there was moreit gets boring very quickly usually in other open world adventures games i find myself exploring the gorgeous open world for hours engrossed in the story and enjoying well written characters yet this game can deliver in none of those things,
4.0,"Amazing game. It's beautiful, the character design is amazing, and there's so much to do. That being said, I have had some recent issues with the game crashing, often when I'm not doing anything I'd think would make it crash. It's crashed when I'm just wandering around, in the middle of dialog, and once right after I had completed a domain, forcing me to redo it. I used the compatibility mode so it would run smoother, but that didn't help with it crashing.",110.0,positive,amazing game its beautiful the character design is amazing and theres so much to do that being said i have had some recent issues with the game crashing often when im not doing anything id think would make it crash its crashed when im just wandering around in the middle of dialog and once right after i had completed a domain forcing me to redo it i used the compatibility mode so it would run smoother but that didnt help with it crashing,

5.0,"Initially, I had a 5-star review. I can no longer keep that review anymore in good faith. I love the art style of the game, the music is amazing, and the world itself is very beautiful. A few months ago, I finished the main story. When this new patch update dropped, the main story was finished really quickly, same with the character story quest. This game just seems to have gotten stagnet. Things we have been asking for have been put into HSR instead. Personally it's annoying.

5.0,"It's one of the few mobile phone games I play, I just started playing, and honestly, it's the most fun I've had in a game for a long time. I'm glad I got it. It also supports external storage on devices that allow for external memory sticks to be inserted into them. Thr game has an ""optimized"" feature in the graphics section of the games Options Menu.

3.0,"Been playing since Sep 2020. The game is beautiful. I love the different nations, character designs, the undtrack is top-tier, and I really enjoy the world exploration, puzzles, and battle. It was difficult for me to leave such review, but the current state of the game has left me pretty much disappointed and frustrated. Late-game content is dull, monotonous and tedious, and the so-called ""rewards"" are insulting, measly, and just plain stingy, even for a gatcha game.

5.0,"This is an awesome game! The main story and side quests are extremely well-written and immersive, all the countries are well designed and have many enjoyable puzzles to unlock various rewards, and the elemental fighting system is really unique and fun.

5.0,"There is so much to do in this game as long as you do certain quest, its like a rollercoaster with high, lots of quest to lows. The harder it gets, the higher level you get. Definitely can cost money if you want to wish for more characters or special weapons or purchase special items. However, it uses a lot of memory. If it gets sluggish, then you don't have enough memory! Also, later on, if you don't build your characters correctly, you will have a difficult time, repetitive farming battles.",337.0,positive,there is so much to do in this game as long as you do certain quest its like a rollercoaster with high lots of quest to lows the harder it gets the higher level you get definitely can cost money if you want to wish for more characters or special weapons or purchase special items however it uses a lot of memory if it gets sluggish then you dont have enough memory also later on if you dont build your characters correctly you will have a difficult time repetitive farming battles,
5.0,"I've played this game for about 3 or 4 years, only a little after its release, and it's been pretty fun, I like some aspects of the game, like the lore, gameplay, characters, but overtime I feel like the events and story have been getting boring or repetitive.

4.0,"A lot to do in a massive open world, variety of characters and elemental powers with multiple weapons including mages. Its a long term game. Downside its insanely difficult to get artifacts to equip characters with the stats you are looking for plus in a single run to farm them it has two different types of artifacts instead of one which makes it even harder. You'll spend lot of Resin (energy) to get barely or exactly what you want just to build a single character.

1.0,"I really liked this game. The early game story was fun, and I liked the older characters. But there are a ton of issues that the players continue to bring up that fall on deaf ears. The later game play doesn't even scale up the exp of the random bad guys you run into on the map as your world level increases, so it's much more difficult to level up your characters in later gameplay. Along with random bugs and things, they just refuse to fix. Needles to say, I won't be re-downloading this one.",1282.0,negative,i really liked this game the early game story was fun and i liked the older characters but there are a ton of issues that the players continue to bring up that fall on deaf ears the later game play doesnt even scale up the exp of the random bad guys you run into on the map as your world level increases so its much more difficult to level up your characters in later gameplay along with random bugs and things they just refuse to fix needles to say i wont be redownloading this one,
3.0,"Two stars docked because of personal opinions that most people in the reviews have already addressed (poor recent character designs, slow story). I just wish there was an option that let us pick which commissions we want after we reach the max reputation in a nation (at least).

5.0,"As a beginner, Genshin Impact is rlly rlly fascinating. It is breath-taking, adventuring and its graphics are rlly smooth. Apart from those advantages, the game takes up a lot of space, it's 31 GB. Besides, there are a lot of theories and items we need to understand properly which is difficult to play. Well, the game's rule is ""knowledge is power"" so makes sense. Overall 5 out of 5 star, no errors nor problems yet.

Now, the devs have lowered the draw distance so that when ever you explore you just see low resolution polygons and place holders until you're right beside an object. Buildings look like toy blocks and Mountains look like they belong in a PS2 game. The grass, trees and rocks pop in as you move around the map. It's just so disappointing compared to how it used to be.

2.0,New rewards for doing story quests with long dialouge options. The character story quests don't even have the character as the main but some random NPC.
