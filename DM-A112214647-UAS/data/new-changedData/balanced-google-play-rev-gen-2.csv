3.0,88.0,positive,while ive reviewed this before i decided to edit my response to my current opinion the game is great the graphics are stunning and the stories are nice however its very long and excessive it makes it feel more like a chore as you get more into the end game getting rewards is a struggle and farming and upgrading characters is more of a hassle than it should be the resin energy cap should be upgraded or costs of energy should be lowered this game is very good just time consuming
3.0,35.0,positive,very fun but i wish there was more fighting in the quests its just a bunch of talking and running around when it comes to the quests that just make me want to leave the game it brings me in with the potential for awesome battles but then turns me off with all the dialogue that you cant skip has a lot of potential at leave give us the ability to skip the dialogue
3.0,11.0,positive,fun game i enjoy the story there is tons to do and tons of content to clear so if youre bored pick it up the problem with it however is the long time between character reruns it has been over a year since some characters are available and it is really killing enjoyment for a lot of people when they arent able to get their favorites
5.0,77.0,positive,this game is phenomenal the art style and scenery are stunning yes the game is long but thats why its fun it takes you on several journeys and gives you memories worth remembering the combat is fun as well and the devs are working on storage control for those having issues with game size i would ignore all those hatefulspam reviews as its mostly just bots or people trying to ruin the joy for others
2.0,14.0,negative,i love this game however it is incredibly laggy to the point where its unplayable i have all the graphics on the lowest setting including the fps and yet it still somehow manages to crash it isnt my storage because i have lots of it to the point where genshin barely makes a dent in it and it isnt my wifi because it runs smoothly for all the other apps please fix this and optimize it better for mobile players
3.0,99.0,positive,i used to be obsessed with this game but i havent played it in months because of how boring and repetitive the gameplay has gotten the developers also dont care very much about player feedback and seem to pick and choose what feedback they use to incorporate into quality of life changes speaking of which it took them years to implement some qol changes that have been requested for years a shame but genshin impacts dev team needs to do better
5.0,65.0,positive,highly recommend i have been playing the game since last year and have been very impressed with the mechanics and captivated by the storyline constant updates keep the game interesting and ensure that the player stays engaged lore is impressive graphics are great during gameplay and absolutely awesome during cutscenes especially since update very very impressed have reccomended to many of my friends and all have enjoyed and are still playing the game till this day
4.0,29.0,positive,hello i absolutely love this game it has incredible graphics and is a ton of fun to play but lately whenever i try to open it it says that the game has a bug and kicks me out before i even get to the loading screen it says the developer needs to fix the issue before the game can be opened please fix this issue i love you game i always look forward to playing at the end of my day thank you
4.0,64.0,positive,ive been playing this game since january th i have no real complaints the style is nice not too much fan service the characters are all interesting in their own ways and theres soooooo much more thats gonna be added to the game not making it boring i have an old phone samsung galaxy se and it still runs smoothly sometimes itll glitch but not as bad as my pc since my pc was running on its last bits of life it exploded while i was playing this game
1.0,14.0,negative,uninteresting characters uninteresting dialog a story with potential that isnt told very well it has been years and the games story isnt complete i would have rather they not relesed it until there was moreit gets boring very quickly usually in other open world adventures games i find myself exploring the gorgeous open world for hours engrossed in the story and enjoying well written characters yet this game can deliver in none of those things
4.0,110.0,positive,amazing game its beautiful the character design is amazing and theres so much to do that being said i have had some recent issues with the game crashing often when im not doing anything id think would make it crash its crashed when im just wandering around in the middle of dialog and once right after i had completed a domain forcing me to redo it i used the compatibility mode so it would run smoother but that didnt help with it crashing
5.0,644.0,positive,love the game but a couple issues one it takes up sooooo much space on my phone two it is so hard to get any other characters than the storyline ones it is an amazing game and i would definitely recommend edit ok im back ive gotten so many new characters my friend taught me how to use the wish system hehe also ive only gotten to the geo archon quest but fontaine is a beautiful city i cant wait for the new update one thing mobile is glitchy i understand why though
5.0,665.0,positive,initially i had a star review i can no longer keep that review anymore in good faith i love the art style of the game the music is amazing and the world itself is very beautiful a few months ago i finished the main story when this new patch update dropped the main story was finished really quickly same with the character story quest this game just seems to have gotten stagnet things we have been asking for have been put into hsr instead personally its annoying show us some love
5.0,432.0,positive,its one of the few mobile phone games i play i just started playing and honestly its the most fun ive had in a game for a long time im glad i got it it also supports external storage on devices that allow for external memory sticks to be inserted into them thr game has an optimized feature in the graphics section of the games options menu itll analyze your device and automatically adjust the game to run as smoothly as possible for said device its very nice
3.0,212.0,positive,been playing since sep the game is beautiful i love the different nations character designs the undtrack is toptier and i really enjoy the world exploration puzzles and battle it was difficult for me to leave such review but the current state of the game has left me pretty much disappointed and frustrated lategame content is dull monotonous and tedious and the socalled rewards are insulting measly and just plain stingy even for a gatcha game please do better
5.0,412.0,positive,this is an awesome game the main story and side quests are extremely wellwritten and immersive all the countries are well designed and have many enjoyable puzzles to unlock various rewards and the elemental fighting system is really unique and fun with a few exceptions all the characters are beautifully designed and its fairly easy to get enough resources to obtain them i highly recommend this
5.0,337.0,positive,there is so much to do in this game as long as you do certain quest its like a rollercoaster with high lots of quest to lows the harder it gets the higher level you get definitely can cost money if you want to wish for more characters or special weapons or purchase special items however it uses a lot of memory if it gets sluggish then you dont have enough memory also later on if you dont build your characters correctly you will have a difficult time repetitive farming battles
5.0,1301.0,positive,ive played this game for about or years only a little after its release and its been pretty fun i like some aspects of the game like the lore gameplay characters but overtime i feel like the events and story have been getting boring or repetitive especially recently ive also been getting disappointed with new character designs like emilie the natlan characters sethos they just dont feel as special to me as the older ones do then again end game experience isnt that great
3.0,11.0,positive,i feel like this game would be a lot more fun if it didnt use as much as it did it eats up my battery my storage my wifi and so much more when it doesnt even load a lot of the time i understand its a big game and that it needs a lot of resources to function but doing all of that and still crashing every single time is ridiculous any time i actually am able to play it its amazing but im seriously thinking about giving up on genshin
4.0,434.0,positive,a lot to do in a massive open world variety of characters and elemental powers with multiple weapons including mages its a long term game downside its insanely difficult to get artifacts to equip characters with the stats you are looking for plus in a single run to farm them it has two different types of artifacts instead of one which makes it even harder youll spend lot of resin energy to get barely or exactly what you want just to build a single character developers should improve this
1.0,1282.0,negative,i really liked this game the early game story was fun and i liked the older characters but there are a ton of issues that the players continue to bring up that fall on deaf ears the later game play doesnt even scale up the exp of the random bad guys you run into on the map as your world level increases so its much more difficult to level up your characters in later gameplay along with random bugs and things they just refuse to fix needles to say i wont be redownloading this one
3.0,14.0,positive,two stars docked because of personal opinions that most people in the reviews have already addressed poor recent character designs slow story i just wish there was an option that let us pick which commissions we want after we reach the max reputation in a nation at least its so annoying trying to get certain ones that unlock some sort of storyline for an achievement it would be cool if we could just interact with the commission board ourselves and pick it out
4.0,0.0,positive,its a pretty good game good graphics cool designs for characters nice storyline and voice acting you can freely explore the game but once you get to a high ar it gets quite boringi would try and make it where you give like a permanent mini game otherwise its a great game
3.0,256.0,positive,this is a really great game and i do enjoy it a lot whenever i try to come in i love to explore and accomplish the quests that come with the exploring however there are a few things that i noticed recently that has completely changed me thoughts during the in game experience whenever i try to sign in it tends to be very laggy and it crashed several times another thing i do want to point out is the fact that there isnt much fun updates or attention that is put to this game as the others
5.0,170.0,positive,genshin impact is a visually satisfying beautiful game controls are simple and the crossplatform experience is seamless i can play on my console at home my laptop when traveling and pick up where i left off on my phone when im on the go and all without spending a dime if i dont want to this story is immersive and always evolving with new characters and adventures constantly being added im just really impressed with every aspect of genshin impact and cant recommend it enough
4.0,115.0,positive,i love genshin and there characters and story also exploration is fun but the resin cap is very annoying as a ftp it makes building a character ten times longer and harder and sice genshin is so big now it makes it even harder to keep up also the storage issues are getting really bad even if i delete past data but besides that genshin is a beautiful game they fixed a lot of issues yay still hate how much storge it is
2.0,41.0,negative,on a strong mobile android the fps and lag overlaps everything from even moving or hearing audio it gets so severe that its aggravating to deal with while playing every time it turns completely unplayable editing the review because since the newest update for natlan the game takes minutes to even load a cutscene or walk an inch to somewhere it even crashes the game entirely at the lowest graphic settings this wasnt an issue until this update
5.0,1280.0,positive,youve seen the adds youtubers sponsoring this the whole yards i am here to tell you after a few days of playing that the game is actually pretty good it definitely fills that need to upgrade and slowly become stronger with equipment and characters it also doesnt make the mistake of having high level enemies you cant possibly fight near the beginning a common mistake many games make it eases you in and slowly introduces more and more game mechanics as it should for now i am hooked
1.0,1348.0,negative,the gameplay play is great characters are neat and the open world exploration is fun being forced to sit through more than seconds of dialogue is frustrating because its not interesting id like to be able to skip all dialogue without having to sit through it lastly making it easier to level up existing characters constellations without using wishes would be great i have new characters who i wont use because its too hard to level up my existing characters
3.0,75.0,positive,great game in many aspects terrible in terms of others so imagine breath of the wild but with better graphics better lore and storyline arguably better characters world is very well designed so are characters nothing remotely challenging in the game though other than spiral abyss after completing the story the game becomes a rinse and repeat of just doing dailies every day and resin grind events are terrible feel like mini games within a game and barely utilize any of the characters
3.0,27.0,positive,it does have great characters and storyline and what not but it is becoming more and more a task honestly this game needs more permanent features like what windteace even had to offer that was the most fun ive actually had on this game in a while the daily grind of stuff and farming and questing is boring but have to do it to progress the characters in game please hoyo give us more permanent friendly competition in game without it being a waiting game for an event to come around
5.0,94.0,positive,playing for about a half year i can assure you it is a good and pretty fun game it is not the type of game that you can play for a few minutes but one you gonna spend two hours on without noticing it was this long already figuring some things might need a bit of googling but theres plentiful guides and advice everywhere theres quite a lot of stories and dialogues which i sometimes not have mood for and would appreciate some skip button but some might enjoy that
5.0,82.0,positive,when it started a couple years ago it felt like a breath of the wild clone huge world climbing gliding good fast reactive controls fun combat i was impressed all that for free then they kept increasing the size of the world enhancing the ui adding more story adding more cool characters new abilities and reasons to explore and the story and voice acting is actually good it started damn good and has only gotten better really well done and free its amazing
5.0,167.0,positive,i absolutely love this game the graphics story exploration characters everything its so much fun and has a good variety of mechanics to use and find out its fun building characters too my only two problems are one it would be nice to have a reroll option on artifact substats this would make artifact farming much better for me two more primogem rewards thats the currency used to get weapons and characters and i really wish events and even chests had a bit more rewards for that
5.0,57.0,positive,loved playing genshin on my phone though as of currently i cant even open up the game to play without it shutting itself down it doesnt even get to the loading screen it just shows the hoyoverse screen and immediately shuts down my phone says theres a bug that wont let me open the game until the developer fixes the bug i have a samsung galaxy with gb im pretty sure there isnt anything wrong with my phone as well ive tried deleting it and redownloading it doesnt work
5.0,264.0,positive,from the story lines combats quests scenery and exploration are truly amazing in their own way i never gotten bored of playing since there are so many things to do in this game i noticed that the archon quest in some characters had no voice lines in which it makes the story quite boring and wishing there are possible ways to actually play with other traveler like events overall its an amazing game
5.0,49.0,positive,its a wonderful experience between virtual reality and real life i love this game because it has awesome gameplays storylines characters and lots more the best part is you can play it with your friends or make new friends it in the events are wild like the dendro archons event i wish to have more events like this too but the bad part is that some quests are hard for new players like me one of it made me unable to coop for months
5.0,11.0,positive,as a beginner genshin impact is rlly rlly fascinating it is breathtaking adventuring and its graphics are rlly smooth apart from those advantages the game takes up a lot of space its gb besides there are a lot of theories and items we need to understand properly which is difficult to play well the games rule is knowledge is power so makes sense overall out of star no errors nor problems yet bonus the characters designs humors and stories are also striking
5.0,115.0,positive,i love this game quests are very interesting and there are lot of interesting caracters but there are few issues firstly it takes a lot of space secondly it takes lot of time in loading also recently in the dialogues caracters are muted exept for paimon and please solve this issue it would be also nice to give us more rewards like in honkai star rail but i really recomend this game because once you start playing the game youll never going to quit it
3.0,5.0,positive,the game used to be beautiful now the devs have lowered the draw distance so that when ever you explore you just see low resolution polygons and place holders until youre right beside an object buildings look like toy blocks and mountains look like they belong in a ps game the grass trees and rocks pop in as you move around the map its just so disappointing compared to how it used to be playing since version on galaxy s ultra and ps
5.0,78.0,positive,i love this game especially for the experience when exploring new territories and it meets my expectations as a player such as when climbing and the expectation that there is always something above even though there are no treasure chests teleportation or anything else it still feels satisfying because of the beautiful scenery designbgm the patterns in this game feel consistent the downside is that there are some side quest bugs that make the action button on the character disappear
4.0,97.0,positive,i really like genshin impact and the storyline is amazing i love the character designs and the different play styles i wouldve rated it five stars but unfortunately lots of the characters are mute and the silence feels so loud the quests without the voices of the characters just dont feel right please get the eng voice actors back
1.0,13.0,negative,the game randomly decides to turn off my data during gameplay not sure how to explain it but during playtime my data connection suddenly claims no service pulling me out of the game after it did and i go to my home screen the signal is back this only happens whenever i open this game i live in a place where data signal is very strong so i dont how that was possible wifi is fine but the data one is the problem
5.0,83.0,positive,this game has big flaws such as how long it takes for characters pr weapons to rerun the resin respawn rate and having more characters than but aside from that this game has an amazing storyline enjoyable characters and so many different stories through the quests and events incredible music super fun gameplay mechanics world building and an astonishing scenery but overall you can tell how much effort love and passion they put into it its a experience and a real journey enjoy
4.0,19.0,positive,this game has great story and lots of quests to do how ever the end game content is hard to play on my phone i dont know if its just mine but the character icons r small so it makes it hard to press and if i get hit by an enemy it joystick reset so i had to move my thumb up and down it can tell my thumb is there after playing for years prosgreat story and quests consend game is hard to play when the icons r smalls and the joystick cant if my thumb on it
3.0,10.0,positive,overall fun game good story arcs good character and world design interesting combat system with elemental reactions you could easy spend months theory crafting team compositions with the skills and battle system i would rate it higher but they dont provide all game features to android certain options like controller support are available on ios but not on android
3.0,3.0,positive,this game is amazing but the fact that so many characters do not even have a voice like kinich just ruins the gaming experience it does not feel like im completing an archon quest and alot of the dialogues are beginning to seem weird please do not ruin the game like this the lore is something i love about genshin
4.0,89.0,positive,the game overall is fine it just sucks that we cant really skip any dialogues and we just have to sit through them the storage it takes is also ridiculous but kind of understandable however we have to just wait until version comes out usually this would be fun but the recent banner ends about hours before the new banner comes out the limit sucks and doesnt make sense the same goes for different ascension materials coming on different days also better rewards please
2.0,31.0,negative,for someones first gacha game it isnt bad but after playing it for over years on phone and pc there are very glaring issues it takes too much space both on the pc and phone the early game content is pretty good but it falls off drastically after a few months it gets repetitive quickly a lot of fetch quests the game treats you like you are during the story constantly repeating dialogue as if you werent there paimon gets a lot worse over time never lets us think
4.0,14.0,positive,the graphic was great gameplay was fun and the scenery breathtaking beautifulbut i cant give full star because major problemthis game the story waaaayyyyyyyyyyy to much talkingyap yap yap yap yapand we cant skip the conversationit takes around to minutes sometimes even more than minutes from yapping non stop the annoying voice of paimonif we cant skip it then we better watch anime or movie just by clicking we need skip button
4.0,22.0,positive,as a new players it is both an incredible and frustrating experience the exploration characters and lore are well crafted and stands out from other similar games each archon quest is memorable and exciting even with its flaws in the writing sometimes the downside in my experience is the banner system that has not change since ages ago the main problem is increasing number of characters in the game making it impossible to accommodate reruns effectively
5.0,31.0,positive,ive not been playing for long but no ad freedom play no lost of energy and play when you choose i love that i dont need to play with people but as i get stronger i really feel i need to but i dont want to that the bad side but im still learning about the game it reminds be of minecraft but soo much better at the art and design details i do have to say it a lot of reading the travelling around is really great and random fighting with random things to do it always keep you busy
4.0,0.0,positive,the game is pretty good gameplay is smooth and stories are amazing everything all good but theres one bug when entering the game after around seconds the game crashes and kicks me out been trying to fix that problem for long time but no luck
2.0,34.0,negative,this game is amazingbut since todays morning ive had a problem of the game not working it would launch normally but after the logo appears it would kick me out of the application after times i got a notification that the game is bugged and devs need to fix it my friends dont have that problem at all i cant play the game please fix this problem i uninstalled and reinstalled reset my device checked my storage connection and everything i could its still not working
4.0,4.0,positive,love the game and all but one problem with the voice acting in the recent event of nahida almost everyone doesnt get voiced i hate it so much because i love everyones voice so much i hope that you hoyoverse fix this problem of one of the studios for vas is trying to use ai which i hate please dont let that studio use bad ai voices it makes me mad fix it please also its the en vas
1.0,258.0,negative,the games good yes but for some reason its lacking a lot of vital features the domains are a pain to do over and over again for good artifictsit significantly impacts gameplay and makes the game play feel like a chore and not fun like it used to in the start there should be a feature to skip the domain gameplay after youve played it five or so times like the cooking mechanic and the standard banner needs a serious update and rework
5.0,8.0,positive,its an amazing game i love the characters and storyline the graphics are stunning and exploring each new region feels like entering a different world i always look forward to updates especially with new characters and quests i do have one suggestion though it would be great to have a translator in the chat box communicating with players from other countries in coop can be challenging and a translator would make teaming up so much easier
5.0,71.0,positive,genshin does not deserve those star reviews its a great game with really nice quality and character designs its story quest are wonderful be it the main story quest or world quest it can be quite annoying to sit through the more uninteresting dialogue but at the end of the day its perfectly fine you just need a bit of patience it fits in a lot of play styles and almost anyone can find something they like about the game i would say more but im at the mark in short get the game
2.0,4.0,negative,not a bad game but very hard to play on mobile im on android so the game doesnt provide any controller support which for a game that has such a thing on ios and any other platform its released on is just wild to me its absurd that i could use a controller for this game on literally any other platform but android without rd party interference
3.0,5.0,positive,its fine i like the story and the characters but its easy to get burnt out from this game the bp and welkin make little difference resource scarcity makes me have to grind more with no way of making it easier domains are horrible and i can never roll into any good artefacts the rates are just bad all around id get star characters i dont want and then i end up spending upwards of to get a character i do want please dont be dumb like me and spend money on this game
4.0,15.0,positive,honestlyi just downloaded it yesterday and i love it i like how its like watching an anime and playing at the same time usually games with a story line makes you read a lot if i wanna read all that i would read my fav webtons instead so i skip it mostly but this has a lot of audio so i love that one thing that i dont like so far that the characters are a bit slow making her run drains the stamina quickly oh and it takes a lot if space like over gb its a lot
1.0,254.0,negative,the game the story and graphics are very good but the controls are sucks please make the dpad movable and same as other buttons so we can adjust atleast their place in the screen im doing unintentionally actions especially with the dpad that is very low in the screen when i touch it the character automatically moves forward please fix the control buttons and dpad and make them adjustable
5.0,23.0,positive,its a great game but grinding for character leveling is repetitive weekly domains make it difficult to improve a character and premium currency primogems is difficult to come by but if you get past any qol issues its a beautiful rpg with fun gameplay and an excellent storyline top notch cant wait for the new areas in next patch
3.0,3.0,positive,its a great game with good quality and world building and its world exploration is vast but i find it hard to obtain rewards since you have to do extensive grinding to get primogems not only that but theres no skip button its annoying honestly
5.0,20.0,positive,years playing daily one of the best live service games nowadays everything has its ups and downs but genshin is an amazing piece of art especially the music and the game is part novel part adventure lots of exploration puzzles and constant events with different minigames i love it
4.0,7.0,positive,been wanting to play this game for a long time now and finally found compatible device to play it its as amazing as i thought although maybe some suggestions ticket system when wishing on new banner for players that already have constellation of certain characters in it if the same character appeared again that character will be turned into ticket of its corresponding stars stars collect enough ticket to exchange for character from older banner hope thisll help
5.0,6.0,positive,one of the best games i have ever played on mobile or pc or anywhere this game has the best ost musics scenery landscapes storyline character design and many more things truly a masterpiece only issue is the devs are not providing enough primogemsin game currency to pull for upcomming banners if only they could give free pulla worth every major update would have been really nice although its not a major issue still a bit problematic but i really love this game
1.0,18.0,negative,its pointless playing this on play games now that the coupon is gone might as well uninstall and play on pc exclusively other than that the game isnt really worth keeping on your phone to be real its take up too much space and youll have to go through countless lines of event exclusive and nonrepeatable dialogue before reaching the endgame the story itself meanders and so many filler characters get introduced bc of their gacha system which limits their story potential not a fan
4.0,0.0,positive,i took a huge twoish year gap from it until fontaine got released since then its been a lot more enjoyable for me to play for a few reasons like characters power design etc areas farming the artifact system and so on but it also sucks for a few reasons like ugh natlan and characters released since and including emily have been pretty eh the new main story style where we have to save people i also hated a lot but maybe because natlan is just so ugly to be in
1.0,37.0,negative,the game is fun and runs well in my phone the story is great no complains there but why the star well its the controls the onscreen controls are absolutely terrible in this ios has controller support why not android i cant mention the number of times i accidentally clicked on a characters ultimate when i was trying to jump or change the camera angle because everything is so close to each other please add controller support to android its been years since this game launched ffs
4.0,34.0,positive,improved experience a little with in game settings and taking a break from all the fights in game the aesthetics are still worth the time ive spent in game along with the story that devs are putting out i guess rushing head first into the game can make you loose perspective of the escape that you need from games thank you for the game hoyoverse
1.0,107.0,negative,it was a great game before but after playing it for years you got tired of it no major improvements in terms of qol for the entire game generally artifacts system never changed story dialogues takes so much time even the voices are gone now the gacha didnt improved at all limited weapon banner just got to its original one form its becoming worst for me i still play the game but not as excited as before lots of restriction also deceiving its audience
5.0,25.0,positive,gi its was a fun adventures game i played it a years now its not easy to ascent the character need to work more harder to make through it not everyone gets lucky enough to get a strong characterweapon and artifek for some player even they are spending a lot primogens intertwine fate they still cant get a strong gold characters weapons overall game was fun if only developers can add mark sign more than i always get lost or forgetting where i should go to farming
5.0,27.0,positive,best action and adventure game i have aver play in smartphone updates are best and graphics are heart touching character design is bestthe game starts with a journey and as we go through that journey it feels like we are the main characters of the game the story development character development visuals and gameplay of the game are awesome i would love to play this game in future too
3.0,14.0,positive,the game was fun at first but then it got boring as i progressed the rewards suck too if this game wants us to pull for new characters then the rewards have to be good it takes me hours just to get pulls i love the character designs but like i said its almost impossible to pull a character without spending money
1.0,0.0,negative,please fix the dumb bug i cant get my primogems from old achievements from older commissionquest like the tales of winter to achieve telling it how it is and geo travel diary for the geo archon anecdotes in liyue i cant finish the dumb achievements for some unknown reason even if i do it to times already
4.0,2.0,positive,scamtifying elixir the twin mc are kids i prefer a grown up version npcs are just a copy paste mostly looks the same with slight differences only and lack of details and design which make them looks boring the other game out there did a very good job though on details combat experience is not that good because this game rely on elemental reactions dodge mechanics is boring because you only sprint its better with slow or a real dodge animation
1.0,116.0,negative,this game is actually really good the problem is my phone i waited for like hours or more when installing the updates etc i slept while installing the shades and when i woke up it was still installing but when it was finally done its really good but really laggy my phone is new and not old and when i stopped playing genshin impact and came back again i had to download updates and more shades its getting annoying since its not worth the wait and i wasted gb on this game
2.0,7.0,negative,its hard to give a good rating when the few things that are worth playing genshin impact is its story and even then some story like inazuma are bad and its music the rest of the experience for the gameplay such as levelling characters talents and artifacts exploration quality of life fixes and many more are not worth it you can just watch on youtube for the story and listen on spotify for its music
3.0,4.0,positive,ive played this game for about years now and the damage text bug no grass cant see ice and dvalin and signora bosses are still not fixed im not sure if this is a phone problem or a hoyo but please do update and tell us about the situation abt the bugs stated cos i am still in denial and woukd take greater lengths just to be able to see damage on my mobile screen
5.0,137.0,positive,the best game playing it for years and this is actually unbelievable a lil addicting and some quests r boring but with the new updates genshin is definitely getting better love the new characters and everything stars def but the storage is a lil too much for some players maybe fix that the only issue i have is that my wifi is rlly bad and the game requires good wifi so thats the only issue i face otherwise great game and i love it im hooked
3.0,9.0,positive,everything in the game is fine honestly except the standard banner stuff when players pull in that banner they actually want the standard character not a random useless character i can understand its a luck but what make it worse is losing at high pity like hopefully you change this system like if you are gonna make the players lose the then make it on first not up to
3.0,11.0,positive,this game has some really interesting storylines but some are very boring which makes it frustrating to play its hard to farm as a fp and takes so much time and dont even get me started on char building the only things i like about this game are the characters and the graphics i literally only play for the characters but i dont have time to build them
4.0,0.0,positive,im very happy with the game rewardsand other things the end game is quite challenging but very fun but right now i was building my teapotbut i want it like have a lake but to have a lake i must glitch st and its kinda annoying and i hope hoyoverse would just make an option to create a lake water foundations it will be so helpful thank you
5.0,21.0,positive,such a beautiful game im glad i installed this on my galaxy a it runs beautifully i grew up playing games like the legend of zelda i love the art style and enormous open world to explore the music and voice acting are perfect and the story is as complex and interesting as any fan of hoyoverse can hope for im finally able to enjoy this timeless work of art from my favorite dev team
5.0,940.0,positive,thank you genshin for giving me an unforgettable gaming experience ever i really love the graphics character designs stories theme musics and the ethereal scenery however in the latest story where we have to escape from the night kingdom i experience a horrible lag plus there is a time limit for us to reach the wind current im well aware that my poor device is more likely to be the problem but i would be really grateful if you expand the time limit so im not stuck here forever
5.0,20.0,positive,a true perfection from the storyline to gameplay and gatcha everything is perfect about it when i started playing i didnt knew it would be such addicting my most favorite part of this game is that you can do several things all together in one place love collecting characters you got it love storylines in stimulation games got that and fightings yep you will get it too so dont wait for anything else and just play it
3.0,6.0,positive,i have been playing it since a long time and i really do like it but after changing my device to an oppo ae ive been having problems at first it was running well but after a few months itd crash or lag sometimes and id have to restart the game but since two or more months it will black out mid cutscene kick me out of the game and when i get back to the game ill have to start from the same cutscene which will kick me out yet again
5.0,240.0,positive,amazing lore nice gameplay unique characters with cool designs and a beautiful fantasy world that is inspired by real life regions however it is noticable that they dont accurately represent the cultures due to the limitations in skintones another thing that id like to mention is how genshin failed in story telling its more of tell not show and often deviates from the main plotline that is traveller searching for their twin there are more aspects but overall its a great game
5.0,607.0,positive,stars playing on android i started playing during covid and had a great time i have never felt pressured to make any purchases exploring is fun and the puzzles arent too challenging or boring some people play the meta and grind a lot but i dont and have a lot of fun the story is quite interesting but will be boring if you skip dialogue the only thing stopping it from being a star game is the lack of racial diversity and lacking rewards for some quests and irl events
2.0,3179.0,negative,the game forces you to sit through extremely long boring slow loading dialogues for hours with no option to skip despite people asking them for a such an option for years used to be this issue was limited just to the world quest but now the same goes for events as well no matter how much we ask for they never listen to the users update increased rating to stars from cause theyve been making some positive changes and adding more rewards i hope they keep improving
5.0,434.0,positive,the soundtrack and the graphics of the scenery are wonderfull i also like the main story a lot the characters design are cool but i wish there was more diversity but definelly the best thing is all the regions with its own characters missions and characteristics its so well made sorry if any english mistakes please make simulanka a permanent event
4.0,136.0,positive,the tw hk mo server despite having good connection i experienced a minor laggy garbled storyline introduction when playing and it seems like this isnt fixed however once we got to the point of the intro where we have to choose the characters the lag disappears oh and upgrading to a new phone doesnt solve the issue i believe the issue is the game itself not my network provider indosat the game is capable of providing hours of fun in a vibrant bright world character collection is cool
5.0,675.0,positive,genshin impact is an incredible game with a gripping story breathtaking graphics and topnotch animation the open world is huge and every location is beautifully designed exploring the different areas is always exciting because each place feels special and wellcrafted the combination of worldbuilding and visuals really pulls you in its a game that blends art story and exploration perfectly making it a fantastic experience from start to finish
5.0,381.0,positive,amazing characters designs game play idea events and all just very frustrating when a quests description doesnt help especially when i pause it and go back to the quest and have no clue what to do maybe make the quest descriptions a bit more helpful all in all great game and cant wait for future updates
1.0,4532.0,negative,exploration is good characters and weapons are excellent animations are excellent audio and music are beyond excellent but cant enjoy any of this properly because of the camerasomething that hasnt been fixed even after years constantly fixing the veiw both during combat and in exploration is the reason behind all the seizures and eye problems playing this game on a touchscreen is the worst experience because of the lack of customizable key layout and qol is a joke
5.0,10.0,positive,the game is very good the story line is great the graphics are pleasing too but after playing it for a week the game stated lagging very badly the ui becomes unresponsive the fps drops to zero as the game becomes still all the other graphic intensive game seem to work just fine with medium to high graphics settings on my oneplus t so uninstallating for now
5.0,0.0,positive,hey you guys are doing great really benevolent with the summoning system the characters are amazing the world is fun to explore with the right characters and the story is interesting it is so easy to save up for characters you want thanks to all the events also i really like paimon shes so adorable keep it up guys
2.0,1.0,negative,the game is good the updates are good i just have one problem there are characters that arent rerunning yet and its been a year or more i played for tartaglia because i like his play style and the fact that i joined on the update didnt make it any better i didnt got him on his rerun on i actually felt bad because i played for him and now im playing for more than a year yet i still dont have him i think im gonna quit atp im tired of redownloading games
5.0,42.0,positive,very good graphics for a mobile game but still not on par with the pc version interesting lorestory which is the main reason that i play this game yeah there are some mid quests but overall still greatfor characters you will need to save up some primogems to be able to get the character you want theres also a pity system which is okay the artifact system rng is kinda bad as it requires a lot of grinding and there is no guarantee that you will get a good one
1.0,68.0,negative,sitting through hours of dialogue that i could care less to listen to when ive replayed this game dozens of times is too annoying i wish there was a feature where you could skip the story and cutscenes and just play the game itself this is a good game but as you slowly get to the end it gets harder and harder to find resourses which is in a lot of games but this one you literally have to grind for hours just not for me
1.0,106.0,negative,the game has great graphics but a few issues make it frustrating no skip button cutscenes cant be skipped and some are long and dull wasting time as you wait or keep tapping too many side missions there are so many side missions that its hard to make progress in the main story the mission list is cluttered and most missions have unskippable cutscenes adding to the frustration i hope the developers address these issues its becoming too repetitive and annoying to keep
2.0,7.0,negative,the game is usually great but the most recent update is not enjoyable with the lack of english language voiceovers it is especially annoying that some characters speak while others do not it makes the experience very disjointed and makes me not want to play until the issue is resolved
5.0,4.0,positive,started first release i really love the graphics character design and the current update make the weapon banner better than before lower cost also the music of every region is different yet had a very good music the story is also well builded as someone who never skip story and value story so much its kinda disappointing how the community value story so low btw add the skip button for them like people said did people have different taste also pls make commission to pg
5.0,1.0,positive,very overhated game huge world with tons of quests stunning visuals goated plot especially the fontain archon quest the story is really good character building is also really good and this game reminds me of sao all i can say is this game is really good apart from the fans since they are all weird
3.0,0.0,positive,i started in and everything was going relatively well my ping was horrible in asias server so i had to change to hks server but recently after s release my ping has gotten to the point where i couldnt even participate in the coop event without having ms and getting kicked out the same can be said on both asia and hk servers ive tried testing on online games and media to check if theres any problem with my router but no please ill be grateful if it gets resolved
5.0,8.0,positive,out of game the animation of the fight scenes to the amount of detail into each nation is amazing there are tons of characters you can play as and make a team with you can play with friends or by yourself the story is interesting with many twists and turns and emotional roll a coaster with each nation i play this game almost every day and i still love the game
3.0,2.0,positive,this game is amazing i really love the main story and that its a free to roam game the one problem is that i also play on laptop and the game is constantly crashing now the game wont even let me login which is very annoying i tried restarting the laptop and fixing the game i even tried reinstalling it but nothing seems to be working
4.0,0.0,positive,storyline is awesome and love to play but stopped for now as the dialogue has become too long and you cant skip especially for events and side quests some conversations are very unnecessary and boring game has now become too large for my phone this game is better for pc or console
3.0,1.0,positive,i will rate it a star because there is a issue that need to be fixed just like when you try to login your account it will says that too many requests please try again later i even did to contact the genshin support but i think they are not doing anything but i hope you fixed it as soon as possible because i badly miss my account
5.0,0.0,positive,love this game unconditionally players are really friendly and the maps are beautiful story lines are amazing at first i thought a star game would be disappointing but it wasnt its really great im only ar but im already loving it i plan to become really good at the game etc badluck for the people who give bad reviews since devs try to do everything to satisfy you guys ill play this game no matter what never giving up on this lovely game thankyou hoyoberse muahahahaeauheurys
4.0,2.0,positive,after the th anniversary weapon banner pitt of along radiance pity system and free looks like something we deserved for a long time updating ratings from to due to that i hope to get even more rewards in the future and ratings improvement reducing the weapon pity would be a good move for next anniversary also the elixir costs too much needs to be easier to obtain
5.0,0.0,positive,its so fun to play but i dont know much im new player but its so funn u guys should download and try it exploring the vast of world doing questgood graphics good story line and its long you can play as much as you want overall its game never had fun like this when playing game
5.0,0.0,positive,this game gets an unreasonable amount of hate by people who have never played it i highly recommend this game and have had an amazing two years playing it however its for the bulkier phones only crashes and lag do happen on the lowest graphic settings but the characters and story are worth it to me
3.0,10.0,positive,i really loved this game but it takes up way too much storage like gb is way too much for a mobile game if you have a device only dedicated to genshin then go for it because if you have genshin theres no way in hell or any another damn world you can have other apps like sorry but this is ridiculous gb really gb is a lot for a mobile game let alone but the story is great characters and art but it gets boring once youve done quests and exploring the gacha isnt the best tho
1.0,29.0,negative,still no controller support on android after years any feedback given falls on deaf ears and theres a severe lack of qol features considering the games age no proper endgame content and still no artifact loadouts the custom domain creator would have been perfect for endgame content but alas it was temporary as usual the game itself is good but it could be so much more if this tonedeaf company would actually use the money they make to improve it billion dollar company people
5.0,1.0,positive,this is an amazing game with a superb story line the gameplay is great on mobile you really need a decent phone though to run it as i have seen many comments of games crashing etc i have a one plus g runs the game like a dream
1.0,269.0,negative,its alright you can get the game only thing is you have to delete almost all your apps and even after that it tells you sorry you dont have enough space when in the game downloading if it does that for most people then whats the point in having it on the app store for certain devices or maybe fix your game it shouldnt take up that much space especially for a phone
2.0,1.0,negative,there is a bug thats causing the game to not work i deleted all app data and cache data now the pop up says try updating the game after the developers fix it this is only happening to me my friends can still play the game normally
4.0,1.0,positive,i really enjoyed the game and had it for like two weeks i left it alone for three days and my entire save was wiped and i was reset to the beginning i ended up redownloading it and its worked fine so far
4.0,0.0,positive,its a great game but the buttons malfunctions somethimes for example no matter how long or how hard you hold the attack button on mobile it doesnt do a heavy attack which is a problem when doing arlecchino weekly boss buttons cannot be moved so i am forced to play uncomfortably for years
2.0,19.0,negative,game is very slow and not fun after reaching adventure rank or above theres not much to do except character building after reaching a curtain point in game please give us an endless mode for endgame and hopefully a skip button for dialogue because its too slow
4.0,0.0,positive,its amazing but it keeps kicking me out of the game and i keep trying to get up to the jade chamber to grab the paper of snow because i went to checkpoint unlocking it and left the game but when i went back in the game the checkpoint wasnt saved and ive been trying to get up to the jade chamber
5.0,0.0,positive,i have been playing genshin for almost a year now and i like the quests very much it helped me understand the concept of the game and the character designs are very amazing but i dont get why other players get mad for the designs i hope you keep this up ill give stars
4.0,0.0,positive,incredible game with amazing charachters story exploration and combat the only problem is the ungodly amounts of storage it takes up like gb its insane and the gatcha is an absolute scam
4.0,7.0,positive,only four stars due to lack of controller support on android unless something has changed since i last played and the lack of controller support is what made me stop playing im bored enough to play without my controller but i hope you guys consider adding this sometime soon
5.0,0.0,positive,this is favourite game so far i play this game for hours now and the game graphics are dam goodi like the animationsand the characters are pretty good the events are also good rules can be understood no matter what we will support genshin impact
4.0,17.0,positive,my ping is so bad ms edit maybe it was just a bad connection on my part but now the ping is sometime ms down but the lag the lag is still there the game sometimes crashes when its a cutscene and the musicdialogues would be choppy to the point wher i just decided to turn the volume off completely edit so i contacted them months ago and they have surprisingly fixed the issue thou i also contacted my network provdr now my game is running smoothly but stll lags smtimes
5.0,0.0,positive,genshin impact is a really fun game that has a lot of places to go to amazing new heros high quality graphics and an breathtaking story genshin is an online game that you can play with other people like friends and siblings if you have any you need to defeat all of the villains to save your sisterbrother by meeting new heros and you can upgrade your heros by collecting resources all across to map download genshin impact now to know all of the fascinating storys untold
2.0,3.0,negative,the game is too heavy for low end devices please do something otherwise i wont be able to play it anymore edit after the update it has gotten a lot slower even with a strong device im unable to enjoy the game so i would request the developers to think about the size of this game and do something about it
4.0,0.0,positive,the graphics are pretty good i like the story and its lore very much it would be great if you guys put star character interaction on the respective nation like those stars outside of aqthe mc not showcasing or using his powers are pretty much boring when compared to wuwa
5.0,2.0,positive,this is by far one of the best games ive ever played the lore is fantastic the character designs look so cool too even the graphics are great the storyline is amazing as well considering its mainly why i play this game is truly one of the best hands down hoyoverse did a fantastic job with genshin impact edit finally takes up less space thank u mihoyo
5.0,3.0,positive,i love genshin its my favorite game ever the graphics are amazing and so are the characters i love the details in every characters outfit and in the quests i highly recommend playing this amazing game also can hu tao pretty please get a new skin
3.0,1.0,positive,events need to be replayable the en va strike left the previous event voiceless and was unable to enjoy said content in my native language when or if the strike ends the content should be replayable if not the strike doesnt end please seek new vas
1.0,42.0,negative,i take back what i said worst game ever too much dialogues cant skip it taking so long in the cutscene a game is meant to be involving the player to actually play the game not just reading or listening to dialogues all the time if the quest makes us fight or having an actual interaction while having dialogues that would be great but most of the time people just keep tapping cause how boring and long the dialogues are the dev doesnt listen to the players as well not worth anymore
5.0,18.0,positive,i have been playing this game for almost years now everything is azaming osts battle theme lore characters design unique playstyle and open world here is like cant be explained in words its like real experience i havent felt in any other game before and hats off to all developers who did such a great work of art and present it to us i can say they really did put lot of efforts into this game i am really exciting to see where this journey will take us in future thank you all
5.0,1.0,positive,seen this game for a while but never tried it finally playing this as a gamer who is very fond of open world rpg games this game is truly the best open world experience for me on mobile devices game looks too damn beautiful they really did a great job on this one which made me very impressed definitely recommended to everyone who hasnt played it yet not giving it a try means you are really missing something great thanks to everyone who worked hard to create this masterpiece
4.0,0.0,positive,i love the game so far however id like a option to automatically clear the new character stuff but i like the gameplay tho the story is a bit competitive with requirements and without the missions theirs not alot of fun stuff thats non competitive to do im hoping u get more of that gacha currency for missions
5.0,0.0,positive,i love the game so very much but im afraid about those hackers that can ruin accounts i really wanna suggest that once we obtain a star weapons we player couldve able to use that weapon to use for upgrading other weapons or yet we cant dispose it because even though hackers may give the accounts back theyll still ruin the accounts
5.0,0.0,positive,its been a y i play this game everything its good but this game isnt for low end device so dont try to install on low ram devices its might harmful for your device anyway i like art style explore the open world collect charecter story quest etc there many way to having fun
2.0,5.0,negative,eversince the new update ive been getting too frequent crashes recently on samsung a gb ram like any sudden movements fighting enemies and other things made it freeze then crash and also freeze frames in random seconds even if the character isnt moving including just opening up the menu i already lowered my graphics and experiment it and none of it is suitable
2.0,3.0,negative,the game story wise is good but too boring for old player there nothing to do abyss is easy that new end game mode its also ok i have completed all the quest and now i have nothing to do my daily routine now is just open the game do the boring commissions use resin and close the game gonna uninstall it soon
2.0,0.0,negative,i want you to add a controller for this game you are one separate company with apple product why would you not provide an android controller most of the players are playing with android you can calculate the ratio through download platforms it is hardly difficult you had ps to be compatibility yet cant do with android you first launch in android but never had any controller to be the first one
1.0,36.0,negative,still no skip button which is just absurd at this point and all these characters do is talk talk talk sometimes its interesting sometimes it takes up too much time and can be said in way more shorter sentences this game just really gets on my nerves sometimes
5.0,0.0,positive,i just always find myself coming back to the game ive been playing around so im a pretty veteran player i love story line and combat though i do wish that hoyo would be more diverse when it comes to the skin color of the characters
2.0,0.0,negative,its awesome dont mind the low in game rewards or the odd fandom there is one huge problem that includes co op and the teapot realmi am currently using a phoneand when i build in my teapoti press save afterwardsthenit says for me to waitto wait for the furniture to load inexceptit never goes awaywhich doesnt allow other travelers to visit my sweethard worked mini games that i put in my realmi waited for hoursand actually my wifi and the weather is completely fine
4.0,3.0,positive,my one gripe is the actual lack of skins for the surplus of characters it just feels kind of lazy honestly they release like one or two in an entire year unless its a major event like the lantern rite doesnt help that using mods for skins will end up getting you banned so youre restricted to their like skins compared to the total number of characters and usually theyre for the most irrelevant characters like
3.0,2.0,positive,i really love the game the story and everything but theres one thing im disappointed the story of birthday of nahida some characters dont have a voice when they speak so i need to read what theyre talking to and its disappointing because some characters have a voice and the other have not so when they have conversation its kinda annoying please fixed these immediately so i can appreciate the story of these game more
1.0,7.0,negative,thanks for fixing the game buut every time i go somewhere theres a quest and when you have too many you cant play the real story can you please add like a button so that you dont need to do the other quests also when you try to buy some things with your card it doesnt work even if it does it doesnt give you the things you brought
5.0,0.0,positive,wow this is great game i played this game almost a year and i am still enjoying it if you like open world and free game this is the game for you i played month free then i buy only monthly welkin i wish i bought it sooner since most cost effective deal i think mihoyo should allow new users able to buy or month previous month welkin when making first purchase i thought it was korean game because voice actor were so good if you like open world game this game is worth to try
3.0,0.0,positive,the game itself is very good but it lacks i control we do not have full control overy our character because it is deficult to execute proper combo sometimes we miss click etc we hope youll add controller support to android and ios too so that we can have a better experience handling character
2.0,2.0,negative,when i did the update of the game i lost my account and now im not able to log in its been weeks since i updated the game and im still trying to get in and when i send an email to genshin no one responds to me i have been playing for years and had k dollars on the account and now everything is gone i recommend you dont buy anything on the game and dont waste your time here
5.0,0.0,positive,worth it update so i played this on my potato phone for long from mondstadt to fontaine and worked total fine and it still does exspect natlan it crash soo much just entering their it carshs but still play the other religions smooth natlan is demanding am just stack until i get some expensive medium to play
4.0,1.0,positive,i believe there should be better rewards and if possible please consider reducing the pity rate from to around for freetoplay players as a fan of eula it feels like a long wait to get her since i was playing from the beginning overall best game
5.0,0.0,positive,this game pretty good all place characters and quests are interesting i wont quit the game but this bug is so weird i only play genshin impact for day all are normal before but after i do some quests and i start know all npcs and characters voice line is missing so can you fix this bug pls i really love genshin impact
3.0,1.0,positive,even though game is nice with good graphics but the fact it needed almost gb data to play is insane i am amazed to see this much data for a mobile game i have had played many android games like asphalt gangstar vegas and what not but this game ask for extreme data download requirements
2.0,1.0,negative,ive been playing for years and to give this a star after all this time is sooooo disappointing hours of gameplay event achievements gone out of nowhere until i get my progress back i cant give the five star rating i wanted to give
3.0,1.0,positive,i have been playing this for a while now and this problem always happens problem the game takes so much space and sometime it kicks me out of the app for no reason tho i admit the graphics and the plot and story is good so its still a pretty good game considering it was also laggy
5.0,5.0,positive,update gi offers an incredible openworld and the recent story has been strong as well the dailies system has been improved to reward engagement with quests while also making it easier to use resin and get rewarded the games biggest flaws continue to be a painfully slow character building process and story pacing that prevents fast readers or those bored with events to get through content quickly with a dialogue skip and some more qol i think gi can continue to be a great title
5.0,1.0,positive,it is the best game i played in my phone ever it worth every bit of storage it takes in my phone it has good story graphics quest characters for those who are thinking about downloading this game i have only one thing to say you will not regret downloading this game it may take sometime for get good characters but once you get some standard characters your gaming experience will be at top notch
3.0,3.0,positive,its ok it got a bit better since released we shall see if the quality will improve the quality is not great especially with so many competitors on the market content feels stale we need more endgame activities or weekly rewards that would allow us more chances to get our favourite characters like certain weekly exploration abyss activities of some sorts like hoyo did for the other games it owns
5.0,0.0,positive,i dont understand why people hate on this game ive been playing this game since patch thats some time in but i suppose its more of people following others like sheep this game is really nice if you give it a chance ive been playing for so long and they improve every update they listen to the fandom most of the time and as for the game itself theres so much to do if you like exploration coop main stories they even have cooking and visual novels
4.0,5.0,positive,i have been playing this game since the beginning and i can say that its one of the best ive ever played the story and characters are really good also the combat is super fun this game can be quite exhausting though because you have to spend hours saving up currency for characters wish there was more rewards
5.0,4.0,positive,i noticed a lot of star reviews and decided to up my star i think the game is great and if i am getting bored i simply take breaks i really like the story and the world of the game music is unreal i am a casual player i appreciate that getting stuff sometimes is hard anyway thanks for making this game
5.0,1.0,positive,i had a blast playing genshin from the gorgeous graphics and enticing storyline i love every aspect of this game if i were to give one suggest though it would be a skip dialogue button since i have all the story memorized at this point i highly recommend this game to casual and hardcore gamers and i also recommend other games by the same gam creator like honkai star rail which are both extremely fun and entertaining games
5.0,2.0,positive,i love the game and all the fun stories and quests you get and i love the games scenery and all the characters and everything in it although there are small issues such as lagging for mobile users but its understandable and this is the best game ive ever played it deserves a star rating since it also helps people understand some things that can be used in real life and i recommend playing it
1.0,32.0,negative,theres a insane amount of boring dialogues you cant skip add a skip button seriously the literal amount of gameplay is around mins and then the dialogues take more than mins you have to listen to all that boring talk and just tap on the screen for your life to skip dialogues add a skip button
5.0,0.0,positive,finally hoyo is starting to listen to its players quite a lot of qol changes made so that you can focus more on having fun and spend less time on repetitive nonsense like dailies they even made abyss runs shorter they could afford to be more generous with their freebies considering how much this game is making though even so they deserves stars for how fun natlan is so far keep it up with the qol changes and dont screw things up now
5.0,0.0,positive,even tho i play on my yrs old budget phone this game is beautiful and nows that the loading is kinda faster now with the new updates i loved all changes but suddenly the app got crashes in little times i tried reinstalling yet it results same so can you also focus on low end devices like giving the opt to change the rendering distance or smth like that
4.0,0.0,positive,this game is pretty good although it has some downsides its a very big game and take a while to load its also very hard as a fp player to get the currency in game however the game is beautiful and has a really interesting and deep plot i just wish that it was a little easier overall
4.0,0.0,positive,easy the stories characters and puzzles are sooo good the only thing that i hate is the lack of free rewards not to compare it to the other games but the game feels soo dry at first as a lazy player like me i am forced to grind just to get the characters that i want the community is also good but some players are so toxic
1.0,54.0,negative,update oct cant use google points on pc or to purchase battle passover it update saved wishes over several weeks and still didnt get the banner character the game overall is fun but limited you cannot grind for characters and wishes are expensive but that is the limitation of a gatcha game and probably why my friends and i end up not playing for long periods of time original like it but its very needy and has no controller support for droid users
5.0,2.0,positive,dear hoyoverse i really enjoyed your game its so fun and have a lot of puzzle to deal with not to mention the bosses and enemy i also love the characters and their stories but i really hope that you will put mic party so we can talk and not just texting with our friends it will be more fun if we can just speak with our friends in game
4.0,0.0,positive,i have played this game since release on multiple devices and i have edited this game multiple times this game has amazing open world amazing characters but the black characters dont have any skin color and they are mostly just a lighter tone then the npcs but yes this game is very good but please fix the characters who actually need melanin
5.0,0.0,positive,this is my first time to he addicted to a game like this everything is perfeeect the quality of the game the characters the music the view the quests the world the animation literally awesome highly highly recommend this game d
4.0,3.0,positive,had a bad experience before on my old phone but on my z fold its amazing usually play on pc but have it on my phone as well just wish the file on my phone allowed it to change the controlls so i can use my wireless keyboard and mouse i have used on my fold for fun be accepted as controls which it currently doesnt even recognize as available controls only on this game for some reason as i tried some other racing games and all wasd controls works on them but just not on this
5.0,0.0,positive,bros i cant tell you how much i like this game this is best i had ever played this graphics story everything is better but people say its took too much storage but the developer solve this problem you can delete your old done quest its very helpful for low end device
4.0,0.0,positive,if you want to become the worlds most popular no game just add player vs player function nobody wants to kill beastmonsters bcz its boring to fight againts monster with this game animation and fighting system if u just add player vs player function boom you are the top game in few weeks every one wants a fair fight and thats possible when fighting againts real players please add this function no meed to change anything just enable pvp in game so players can fight each other
4.0,12.0,positive,it has very good graphic experience and every task is interesting and excellent but i dont know that is it my phone problem or game problem but its my new phone and have very large storage space after a week now when i open the game it doesnt open it shows that the game has bug please check with that but other things are awesome
2.0,1.0,negative,its a fun game and all but takes up way to much storage sometimes it would be nice to skip through dialogue other than that i dont have much of a problem i mean it would be nice to get more primogems easier but thats it
2.0,8.0,negative,new rewards for doing story quests with long dialouge options the character story quests dont even have the character as the main but some random npc it just a waste of hours for side quests that dont even feature the banner unit but some no name basic npc now rewards are being given out for exploration and story quests but the amount of drivel aside from the archon quest is way too much if you alt tab they have random one option dialouge to force you to input something its infuriating
5.0,0.0,positive,i honestly used to hate the game because of the cringe players and stuff its not bad at all actualy it has so many quests and stuff and its just keeping you motivated to play more i literaly got to rank n one day and discoverd like parts of the map
5.0,14.0,positive,genshin impact has completely redefined what i expect from an openworld rpg the stunning visuals paired with an expansive world full of life make every moment in the game feel like a work of art the character designs are gorgeous and each one feels unique both in personality and combat style offering endless possibilities for team composition
5.0,1.0,positive,very nice game i bought welkin this week for my hu tao funds when i first saw the game i thought the graphics was just fake but this game truly amazed me the music the characters the scenery thank you for this wonderful game mihoyo hoyoverse this truly made life better so happy with the natlan update and i cant believe ive been playing this game for more than years genshin truly made my life better
5.0,1.0,positive,im waiting forever to start too long for update omg too long conversations sooo stupid and some of the enemy impossible to defeat and why the screen is unstable specially in compat bcz of the camera ancles unstable its really difficult to compat this game is soooo fking stressfull waste of time
4.0,0.0,positive,stars if i canjust because of some bugs accuring here and there and the other world quests that pops up bringing in near impossible puzzles to solve right when you just started when you want to clear up your quest list like an organized person like me also another thing is i already had chapter v natlan archon quest while being in chapter l liyue so when i reached chapter iv fontaine the dock was occupied with the quest for natlan had to say goodbye to fontaine before entering it
4.0,0.0,positive,ive been playing genshin for over years on my laptop and ive never had a problem but recently i got a new phone and since i hv an alt acc in the europe server i tend to switch between my accounts so whenever i switch to my europe server i always need to download some extra resources and if i dont download it on my europe server it automatically downloads in my asia server my main acc even if there is nothing to be downloaded theres no new quests waiting to be downloaded still
1.0,0.0,negative,i like the game but the graphics is so laggy and the chances of getting a star charcater is very low yet we begginers or pkayers always spend primogems so those but in the end we did all is wasteand i also suggest that to increase the amount of character drop and release a star characterthats all
3.0,1.0,positive,omgnice gamegreat animationsamazing charactersleisurely nature soundlike omg its saurrrrr gooood but suddenly today at th october genshin impact stopped saying that genshin impact closed because this app has a bug try updating this app after its developer provides a fix for this error please if theres anything to fixdo it asap since its nahidas bday and the quest i have to complete it and other quests pleaseeee fix it asap great game tbh im giving star for the error
3.0,2.0,positive,right now all of the most up to date gameplay has no voice characters dialog from being to lazy to add it even though this company makes billions off of us and they cant even deliver voice linesi would still recommend the game its beautiful and a ton of content to get through but it definitely seems like they are caring a little less about the game
5.0,3.0,positive,i love the game the character designs are beautiful the story is amazing and the world is stunning they only issues are it doesnt run well on mobile and takes to much space other that that amazing game
5.0,360.0,positive,ive been playing this game for a year and my experiences as a player is going so well the gameplay is good easy to understand and the elemental reactions are also easy to remember and accommodate storyline and plot is good and characters are very pretty and well written i love that there are details that few people knows about i experienced some glitches but it was fixed over time overall i highly recommend this game its really fun and great for time passing when youre bored
4.0,5.0,positive,its the first ever anime inspired game which ive played and its been fine but they dont really care about you as an individual you can get a few wishes if youre free to play but unless you open every chest and do every quest you end up with basically nothing and while the character designs are nice there isnt much diversity especially in skin tones youre better off paying but that can be expensive and i cant really afford itthen i feel sad about not getting characters i like
2.0,1.0,negative,a problem with a message coming up as insufficient storage when i entered after loading the data a message keeps popping up saying that i have the storage but i already tried leaving and relogging in did not work
3.0,2.0,positive,i still dont understand why characters in the latest archon quest and birthday celebration anecdotes are voiceless its just awkward and embarrassing to see paimon being the only one having a voice all the time i hope hoyoverse changes this in the future and not normalize this issue which im sure other players arent amused about
5.0,0.0,positive,could use some fixes to the artifact system rng but overall the game is solid the characters and story are fantastic the music is lifechanging combat is varied and flexible and exploration is fun plus its gotten a ton of qol improvements over the years that have made a great thing even better
5.0,0.0,positive,this game is so good that im addicted to it you can explore play with friends theres a lot going on this game but i wish they add more features like edit the traveler looks i think thats make the game standup more
5.0,1.0,positive,amazing i absolutely adore genshin impact i started playing about months ago and have been completely obsessed with it the storyline game play graphics characters rewards etc are fantastic in fact im going to create a second account and replay the game from the beginning now that i actually know what to do i wish this game could go on forever im looking into playing other games that are similar but nothing seems as good at genshin thank you hoyoverse for this gem
1.0,56.0,negative,stay away from this game i did for yrs then came back to see if i make it to the end it really not worth it i found that out today after grinding again to get my characters weapon artifact and talents up almost everything needs money area rooms that require resin and leveling up drop items that are not guaranteed after defeating a boss its sad bcuz i always pride myself in playing a game through to the end it is not worth it for this game
